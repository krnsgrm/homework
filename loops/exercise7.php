// Write a console program in a class named RollTwoDice that prompts the user for a desired sum,
// then repeatedly rolls two six-sided dice (using a Random object to generate random numbers from 1-6) until the sum of the two dice values is the desired sum.
// Here is the expected dialogue with the user:
// Desired sum: 9
// 4 and 3 = 7
// 3 and 5 = 8
// 5 and 6 = 11
// 5 and 6 = 11
// 1 and 5 = 6
// 6 and 3 = 9
