// Write a console program in a class named Piglet that implements a simple 1-player dice game called "Piglet" (based on the game "Pig").
// The player's goal is to accumulate as many points as possible without rolling a 1.
// Each turn, the player rolls the die; if they roll a 1, the game ends and they get a score of 0.
// Otherwise, they add this number to their running total score.
// The player then chooses whether to roll again, or end the game with their current point total.
