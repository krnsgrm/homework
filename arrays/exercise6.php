// Write a program to play a word-guessing game like Hangman.
//
//    It must randomly choose a word from a list of words.
//    It must stop when all the letters are guessed.
//    It must give them limited tries and stop after they run out.
//    It must display letters they have already guessed (either only the incorrect guesses or all guesses).
